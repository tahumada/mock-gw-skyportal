# mock-gw-skyportal
Mock data for GW follow-up using the Skyportal instance 

The flow of the project:

order |Task | comments | difficulty | who | when
--|--|--|--|--|--
1|make a map folder | take them from [Petrov et al.](https://zenodo.org/record/5206853) or [LIGO]()| 
2|code for creation of events and inject them|
3| observing plans run on Skyportal | trigger the automated creation of observing plans to understand whether they complete and whether the plans make sense
4|select a cadence for upload maps |
5|stream the maps |
6|create observing plans |
7|metrics to assess the quality of the plans (a few?) |
8|simulate transients |
9|check if filtering works |
